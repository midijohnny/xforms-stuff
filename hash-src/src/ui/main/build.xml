<h4>BUILD NOTES</h4>

<p>
As an aside - this single page app was constructed using separate source files - using XInclude.
This makes it easier to organize, manage, debug and evolve the app.
</p>

<p>
I'm statically recombining the components using a combination of 'xmllint' (which understands XInclude) and 'xmlstarlet' (To refactor out repeated namespace definitions)
</p>
<p>
A simple Makefile is used to chain-up the tools.
</p>

<p> I haven't figured out if there is a more canonical structure, but see hash.xml for  what I have come up with so far</p>
<p> This introduces a slight administrative burden - managaging XML namespace prefixes has to be done for every file </p>
